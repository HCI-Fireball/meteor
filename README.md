Our idea is to make an interactive map of Northeasternâ€™s campus as an Android app. A user can use it to identify locations of interest on campus, including buildings, restaurants, transport services, restrooms, etc. They will also be able to route themselves to a chosen location through the app. Other features may be added if time permits.
